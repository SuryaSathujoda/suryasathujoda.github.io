    abstract = {Current reservoir simulators solve Advection-Diffusion-Reaction equations on unstructured grids to a high degree of accuracy but are computationally expensive to use in history matching, optimization and uncertainty quantification workflows. We propose a novel machine learning architecture to auto-regressively predict state variables and well outputs of a reservoir for an ensemble of cases with varying well configurations. This new approach constructs a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model to predict hyperbolic variables (i.e. saturations and compositions), a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) model to predict elliptic variables (i.e. pressure), and a feed forward layer for well outputs. Predictions from the FNO model are fed into the GNN and are coupled in an auto-regressive manner to predict an arbitrary future state of the system given just the initial state of the reservoir. The outputs of the model at each timestep are then fed into the well output layer to predict outputs for each injector and producer well in the reservoir. Results are compared with solutions from a high-fidelity reservoir simulator applied to an ensemble workflow.},

   abstract={Carbon capture and sequestration initiatives make new demands on modern reservoir simulators. To find optimal locations and volumes of CO2 to inject into a subsurface to maximize CO2 storage, we must simulate a large ensemble of injection cases. One possible solution to the computational complexity of this task is to employ machine-learning models which, after a one-off overhead cost of training, can infer and predict future states of a reservoir several orders of magnitude faster than traditional methods.

Most previous work in the literature has primarily focused on either convolution-based methods or, more recently, neural operator-based methods, to predict the evolution of state variables. These architectures have shown promise in predicting on structured reservoir grids but lack the capability to extend the same level of accuracy to unstructured grids. Graph neural networks (GNNs) overcome this bottleneck by incorporating inductive biases arising from local messagepassing mechanisms, facilitating convolution operations over complex graphs and meshes.

In this work, we present a novel autoregressive GNN autoencoder to predict time-varying state variables for an ensemble of CO2 injection cases. We implement a graph convolution network for the message-passing protocol and incorporate physics-informed edge weights between cell connections to guide flow. An exhaustive set of node features are used to train the model on the hyperbolic evolution of phase saturations while preserving the ellipticity in the pressure.

We test the performance of the GNN model for (1) its ability to predict state variables for varying injection rates of CO2, (2) for the post-injection phase, and (3) under different unseen geological configurations. Training and testing are performed by constructing ensembles of 2D, 3D, and real field cases that best represent these scenarios. For the 2D regular grid case, we observe that the model can capture pressure and saturation values accurately, even for highly varying injection rates and with only a limited amount of data. This performance is maintained in the post-injection phase. A key advantage of GNNs is that they show a distinct ability for transfer learning on ensembles of unseen geological configurations. We observe that the model can predict the shape and intensity of wavefronts of certain cases with no prior exposure to the specific static properties during training. Similar results are produced for 3D grids and real field cases.},

    abstract = "{The injection of carbon dioxide (CO2) into saline aquifers is an important strategy for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. However, accurately simulating this complex process is computationally expensive, requiring numerical models handling the underlying physics of the system ranging from thermal effects to geochemistry. In recent years, Physics Informed Machine Learning (PIML) models have emerged as promising complimentary tools to physical simulators, leveraging the power of machine learning while incorporating prior knowledge of the physical system.In this work, we present a PIML model for simulating CO2 injection into saline aquifers. This model is based on an auto-encoder formulation that compresses the state image, that is pressure and saturation distributions and trains a fully connected neural network that can predicts the evolution of the variables in time. The model consists of an encoder that performs the said compression, a transition layer which takes in the well controls and injection rates as inputs, and the decoder that projects the solution from the null space to the original physical space.The training dataset which includes spatial and temporal data for a limited ensemble of reservoir models with varied well controls is generated using a full fidelity physical simulator which performs reactive-transport calculations and models CO2 injection into a saline aquifer. A deep network is trained using TensorFlow and physical loss functions are augmented along with traditional reconstruction losses. The training of large field models is done using a domain decomposition- based algorithm that breaks up the physical domain into smaller sub-domains and the resulting training is about an order of magnitude faster than traditional full field algorithms. Once the training is performed, the model is deployed on a much larger ensemble with validation of random realizations using the physical simulator.We present results on a heterogenous three-dimensional subsurface model and highlight the potential benefits of PIML models, including reduced computational costs, improved accuracy, and increased flexibility. The resulting inference workflow is several folds faster than running traditional full fidelity simulators on an ensemble of realizations. Additional results are presented on cases with deformed geometry and complex structural elements such as faults and pinch out cells.}",
