I am a Data Scientist at SLB, working in the Numerical Simulation team, where my primary role is research aimed at developing physics-informed ML models for Fluid Dynamics.

Previously, I studied Part III Mathematics at the University of Cambridge, focusing on Theoretical Physics and Machine Learning. I did my Part III Essay (Dissertation) on 'Deep Learning for Partial Differential Equations' in the Cambridge Image Analysis Group under Prof. Carola-Bibiane Sch√∂nlieb and Dr. Angelica Aviles Rivero. 

I also hold two undergraduate degrees in Computer Science and Physics, awarded by the Universities of Manchester and Southampton respectively.
