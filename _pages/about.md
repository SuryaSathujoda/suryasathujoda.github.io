I am a Part III Mathematics student at the University of Cambridge, studying Theoretical Physics and Machine Learning. I did my Part III Essay (Dissertation) on 'Deep Learning for PDEs' in the Cambridge Image Analysis Group under Prof. Carola-Bibiane Sch√∂nlieb and Dr. Angelica Aviles Rivero. Prior to starting my Masters, I worked as a Data Science intern at Schlumberger, where I worked on Deep Learning for PDEs in the domain of reservoir simulation for Carbon Capture and Sequestration initiatives. 

I also hold two undergraduate degrees in Computer Science and Physics, awarded by the Universities of Manchester and Southampton respectively.
